Input: prices = [10,1,5,6,7,1]

Output: 6 

Explanation : 7 - 1 (left less right more)




class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
      #  prices = [10,8,7,5,2]
        res = 0                         # intially profit can't be negitive so assaign 0

        lowest = prices[0]              # fixing lowest at starting ele in array so that we can compare and tra verse
        for i in prices:
            if i < lowest:              # if lowest = 10 and i =7 then replace lowest 

               lowest = i
            res = max(res, i - lowest)  # By 1 for loop we are traversing 2 times 2nd time for max(i-lowest)
        return res
